						Hello there, I am <yellow>Saaiq Abdulla Saeed</yellow>. AKA <purple>saaiqSAS</purple>. I am a self-taught Maldivian <green>full stack developer</green> 
						with a pinch of <green>graphics designing</green> and good dose of <green>cybersecurity</green> experience. Currently, 
						I am specialized in <green>Java</green>, <green>Android</green> and <green>native web</green> development. In simple words, I am a very technical person.
						</p>
						
						<p class="container_description_center" style="background-color:#232323">
						Now, you must have a basic idea of who I am and what I do. So, unless you really want to know the details 
						about me you can stop reading now. Otherwise continue reading... or listening, if ‘text to voice’ is what you’re 
						doing. Like I said, ‘very technical person’.  Enjoy!!
						</p>
						
						<p class="container_description_center" style="background-color:#232323">
						From a very young age, or more specifically as long as I started to remember, I was always fond of ‘making’ things. 
						What kind of things? Well, anything that came to my mind. Mostly some kind of a toy. At first, I began making origami 
						out of paper. Which quickly evolved in to making ‘things’ out of cardboard, and soon out of wood. While making ‘toys’ 
						out of these ‘materials’ I even picked up some good knowledge on <pink>electronics</pink> and <pink>mechanisms</pink>. Not without the help of the 
						Internet of course.
						</p>
						
						<p class="container_description_center" style="background-color:#232323">
						It didn’t take long before I started designing my own <pink>mechanisms</pink> and <pink>circuits</pink> for different purposes. And with the materials at hand, 
						I was even able to make and test most of my <pink>mechanisms</pink> and <pink>designs</pink>. Did those work? Yes, most of them did, however none of them looked too appealing to the 
						eye. You see, I was more of the ‘under the hood work’ type person and not really the ‘beautiful car body work’ person.  But over the years 
						I have become better at the ‘beautiful car body work’, hence my end products look as beautiful on the outside as well on the inside.
						</p>
						
						<p class="container_description_center" style="background-color:#232323">
						As time passed by, I became interested in… well, the term ‘<blue>hacking</blue>’. I began doing my research and ended up on the term ‘<green>Linux</green>’. 
						What is that? I had no idea, not even the foggiest clue. Eventually with lots and lots of self-teaching and a hefty amount of time, 
						I was finally well used to the <green>Linux</green> environment and knew more about the art of ‘<blue>hacking</blue>’,
						or as a more innocent name ‘<blue>penetration testing</blue>’. 
						And it didn’t hurt that I was playing ‘<blue>Watch Dogs</blue>’  at the time - 
						Really good motivator to learn all of those ‘gorgeous’ technical knowledge which
						probably were way above my level. Unfortunately, all of those ‘gorgeous’ knowledge still wasn’t enough to even test out a trick. 
						</p>
						
						<p class="container_description_center" style="background-color:#232323">
						At that time, I was basically a '<blue>script kiddy</blue>'. Though I guess that’s pretty good considering the fact that I was only 13-years-old. Well, without knowing 
						any details about networks and not one bit about programing, there wasn’t much possibility for anything serious like a career. 
						So, I wanted to know more.
						</p>
						
						<p class="container_description_center" style="background-color:#232323">
						That’s when I started learning networking and the legendary <green>HTML</green>. Soon I added <green>CSS</green> and <green>JavaScript</green> into my arsenal. But I didn’t 
						really do much with that. Then about a year later I wanted to do something real, something big... like my own software... and yeah, an 
						arsenal with only web languages and a couple of terminal scripting languages aren’t exactly what I needed for such a ‘real’ project. I 
						needed a good robust programing language. 
						</p>
						
						<p class="container_description_center" style="background-color:#232323">
						After some research I decided to start learning <green>Java</green>. While at it, I started my first 'real' project – SAS-STE. That’s when I really began to 
						focus on programing. After months of development, I was able to release ‘SAS-STE-Wizard’ – My first software. Soon after that,
						I started learning Android Development as I wanted to develop a mobile App for SAS-STE. And that I did. I made ‘SAS-STE-Mobile’ and released it.
						</p>
						
						<p class="container_description_center" style="background-color:#232323">
						Now, I had ‘<green>HTML</green>’, ‘<green>CSS</green>’, ‘<green>JavaScript</green>’, ‘<green>Java</green>’ and multiple <green>terminal scripting languages</green> in my arsenal followed by a good knowledge of 
						<green>cybersecurity</green> and <green>networking</green>. Soon I was even able to add <green>graphics designing</green> to that as well. With that I kept on developing and learning 
						more and more. And that’s exactly what I am still doing – developing and learning.
						</p>
						
						<p class="container_description_center" style="background-color:#232323">
						You know... if you don’t know any of the words, ‘technical’ terms or abbreviations mentioned in this ‘big description of who I am’, I would
						recommend you searching them. You’ll learn something... trust me.
						</p>
						
						<p class="container_description_bottom" style="background-color:#232323">
						So, who am I? I am <purple>saaiqSAS</purple>.
